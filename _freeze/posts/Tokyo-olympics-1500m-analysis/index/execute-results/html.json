This blog post employs the concept of critical speed to analyse the pacing strategy in the men's and women's 1500m finals at the Tokyo Olympics 2020.\n\n![The Men's 1500m Finals at the Tokyo Olympics.

The proportion of contribution from either system is often dependent on the exercise intensity levels. Given that venturing into the anaerobic territories is typically associated with fatigue, it has been of interest to scientists, coaches, and athletes to find the optimal exercise intensity to meet the demands of sporting performances.\n\nNumerous concepts have been established in sports science to try identifying key levels of exercise intensity to predict fatigue and performance. One such concept often used in the world of cycling is the concept of *critical power*. In layman terms, critical power represents the highest power output that can be sustained for a prolonged period (approximately 30-60 minutes). It has been purported to be a key 'threshold' that distinguishes between the heavy and severe intensity domains. The latter domain is characterised by rapid increase in oxygen uptake and blood lactate, and the inability to reach steady states. Any intensity beyond the critical power level will result in the athlete tapping significantly into his or her finite anaerobic capacity. Continuous exercise at such high intensity levels will result in inevitably imminent fatigue.\n\nThe concept of critical power is relevant to any sporting performances in which athletes have to exercise in the severe intensity domain. A good applicable example in the athletics will be the 1500m event, which requires significant energy contribution from the anaerobic system. In the context of running, the same concept is termed *critical speed* instead since running is more pertinent to speed than power output. An interesting application of this concept is predicting the time to exhaustion when running beyond the critical speed using the following equation.\n\n[**Time to exhaustion = D'/ (S -- CS)**]{text-align=\"center\"}\n\nThe concept proposes that when one runs at a given speed (S) above the critical speed (CS), the ability to sustain that speed is limited by the individual's work capacity (D'). For example, a runner has a CS of 5 m/s and D' of 200m. If this runner attempts to run at a speed of 7 m/s, it is expected that he or she will reach exhaustion in 100 seconds (as calculated by 200/ (7-5) = 100).\n\n![Illustration of the critical speed concept](image2.webp)\n\n## Calculation of Critical Speed (CS) and Work Capacity (D')\n\nCritical speed (CS) can be computed using the personal records of an individual over different running distances. As illustrated in the figure above, we plot the average speed of one's best performances against their respective time duration. We will derive a hyperbolic relationship between speed and time. On the left side of the curve, we observe an initial steep decline in the speed that we can sustain as the time duration increases. However, the rate of decline slows and beyond a certain point, any increase in time duration corresponds to minimal changes in the speed. The curve eventually approximates the dotted line, termed the asymptote, which represents the CS. In addition, we can also derive one's work capacity (D') from the curve, as denoted by the shaded areas.\n\nGiven that it requires some effort to interpret a hyperbolic curve, an easier and commonly used method to calculate CS and D' is to plot the total work done (distance of event) against the time duration, which has a linear relationship. Next, we fit a linear regression line to the values and interpret the values from the straight-line equation. The slope or gradient of the line represents CS, while the y-intercept represents D'. The figure below illustrates an example of this method to calculate the CS and D' of Timothy Cheruiyot, who is currently first ranking in the men's 1500m event. I plotted his personal best records between 800-5000m (data from IAAF database) and derived the linear regression equation based on these values. The slope of the equation informs us that his CS is 5.74 m/s, and the y-intercept informs us that his D' is 261.30 metres.\n\n![Estimation of critical speed and work capacity from a distance-duration graph](image3.webp)\n\n## Application of the critical speed concept to pacing\n\nIn the recent American College of Sports Medicine 2021 Annual Meeting, a [[research study]{.underline}](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2021/08001/Pacing_Strategy_In_One_mile_World_Records_As_A.152.aspx) demonstrated that 1-mile (1600m) world record performances were ran above CS with complete depletion of D' at the finish line. Since running 1500m is likely akin to running a mile, it is interesting to find out how 1500m event athletes paced themselves in respect to their CS and D'. This blog post examined the pacing profiles of both male and female runners who competed in the 1500m finals at the Tokyo Olympics, whereby runners fought for podium positions instead of world records.\n\nI adopted the same approach as the research study to calculate the CS and D' of all the athletes. Data of individual personal best performances between 800-5000m were extracted from the IAAF database, and the linear regression method was used to derive the CS and D'. Given that very old records may not reflect the athlete's current fitness level accurately, personal bests achieved before 2014 were excluded from the calculation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
