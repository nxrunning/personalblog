Decline of physical function is inevitable with age, but the rate of decline differs among individuals. Several physical performance tests have been established to monitor changes in physical function as individuals age. This blog post presents a dashboard created using R Shiny to show published age-group specific and sex-specific reference values of various physical performance tests for the Singaporean adult population.\n\n[![The Reference Values of Physical Performance Dashboard. Source: Author](Image3.jpg)](https://nxrunning.shinyapps.io/Physical_performance_dashboard/)\n\n## Importance of Physical Performance Tests\n\nPhysical function often deteriorates with age, and such decline is associated with adverse health outcomes, onset of disability as well as mortality. Given the rapidly ageing population globally and locally in Singapore, the burden associated with age-associated functional decline is a key public health concern. Hence, it is imperative for prompt screening of functional decline in the population for targeted interventions to delay functional dependence as best as possible.\n\nPhysical performance tests are valid and reliable ways to assess physical function, and several tests have been developed specifically for the older adult population. These physical performance tests have been demonstrated to predict adverse health events. For example,a recent cohort study reported that the ability to balance on one leg for 10 seconds is associated with all-cause mortality [@araujo2022]. Such empirical evidence demonstrates the value of administering physical performance tests.\n\nImportantly, physical performance tests are very economical as they are often easy to administer and do not require specialised equipment. For example, a sit-to-stand test only requires a chair to administer and can be performed independently, yet the test performance has been shown to predict disability in activities of daily living [@zhang2013]. With such tests, individuals are able to easily evaluate their physical function with minimal resources. Therefore, physical performance tests are feasible and valid ways to monitor physical function at a population level.\n\n## Evaluation of Physical Performance\n\nEvery test is designed to distinguish certain abilities or attributes among different individuals. Clearly, the value of administering a physical performance test is to determine one's functional ability and interpret that relative to the context of the individual. Akin to the score standards set for Singapore fitness tests such as the National Physical Fitness Award (NAPFA) or Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT), it is necessary for older adults' physical performance tests to derive normative value scores to stratify performance abilities.\n\nThe Yishun Study is a local population-based cross-sectional study that determined normative values of various physical performance tests in a representative sample of community-dwelling younger and older adults. This study employed random sampling methods to recruit over 500 participants from the town of Yishun, filling quotas of 20-40 participants in each sex and age group (i.e., 10-year age groups between 21 and 60 years old and 5-year age groups after 60 years up to 80 years). The age- and sex-specific reference values of various physical performance tests have been published in peer-reviewed journals [@choo2021; @lee2021; @pang2021; @abduljabbar2021; @lau2020a]. These values help us to interpret the performance of these tests with respect to each specific age group and gender.\n\n## Reference Values of Physical Performance Dashboard\n\nWith the aim of helping knowledge users to better interpret these reference values, I created a simple dashboard with R Shiny to present score bands for five physical performance tests based on the Yishun Study data: 1) timed up and go test, 2) five times sit to stand test, 3) six metre walk test, 4) handgrip strength test, and 5) knee extension strength test.\n\nThis dashboard assumes a Gaussian or normal distribution. The published mean and standard deviation values are used to estimate the distribution of performance scores for each age and gender group. Performance categories are stratified based on standardised scores, also known as Z-scores, which represent how many standard deviations below or above the mean value. This allows ease of inferring the probability of a certain score. Assuming the mean and standard deviation values are true population parameters, approximately 68% and 95% of scores observed would fall within 1 and 2 standard deviations from the mean, respectively. Using such approach, performance scores can be compared with respect to the mean score determined for each age group.\n\nPhysical performance test scores are stratified into a total of seven categories. Please refer to the table below for the standardised scores that correspond to each category.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"htmlwidget-9b8849dba6000499f495\" class=\"reactable html-widget\" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-9b8849dba6000499f495\">{\"x\":{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"Reactable\",\"attribs\":{\"data\":{\"header1\":[\"Very Good\",\"Good\",\"Above Average\",\"Average\",\"Below Average\",\"Poor\",\"Very Poor\"],\"header2\":[\"2 standard deviations above the mean\",\"Between 1 and 2 standard deviations above the mean\",\"Between 0.5 and 1 standard deviations above the mean\",\"Between 0.5 standard deviations below and 0.5 standard deviations above the mean\",\"Between 0.5 and 1 standard deviations below the mean\",\"Between 1 and 2 standard deviations below the mean\",\"> 2 standard deviations below the mean\"]},\"columns\":[{\"accessor\":\"header1\",\"name\":\"Performance Category\",\"type\":\"character\",\"sortable\":false,\"width\":205},{\"accessor\":\"header2\",\"name\":\"Standardised Score Range\",\"type\":\"character\",\"sortable\":false}],\"defaultPageSize\":10,\"paginationType\":\"numbers\",\"showPageInfo\":true,\"minRows\":1,\"rowStyle\":[{\"background\":\"#2166AC\"},{\"background\":\"#67A9CF\"},{\"background\":\"#D1E5F0\"},{\"background\":\"#F7F7F7\"},{\"background\":\"#FDDBC7\"},{\"background\":\"#EF8A62\"},{\"background\":\"#B2182B\"}],\"dataKey\":\"a5935873d3c0f2c85d6e74f46f7181eb\"},\"children\":[]},\"class\":\"reactR_markup\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n### How to use the dashboard\n\nThis dashboard simply requires two inputs from the user: **age** (in integer) and **gender**. As the published data was derived from only adults aged 21 years and older, the minimum age input is 21. After, you may toggle between the tabs to access the score bands for each of the five physical performance tests for your age and gender group. The scores are presented in a density plot and table format, with each performance category colour coded. I have also included a short description of each test on the left panel. The video file below presents a quick demonstration of the dashboard.\n\n\n{{< video Media1.mp4 >}}\n\n\n\n### Dashboard Link\n\nThe dashboard is currently published and hosted on Shinyapps.io.
