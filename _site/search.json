    "text": "We experience a wide range of sensations during exercise. This article highlights the importance of studying perception, especially in the context of regulation of exercise.\nHave you ever stood at the end of a marathon, and witnessed how many people sprinted across the finish line? How is it possible for somebody who slowed down or was walking halfway through the race and yet managed to run the fastest right at the end of the race?\nThis is the end-spurt phenomenon commonly seen in endurance events among elites as well as the recreational athletes. Such phenomenon challenges the concept of fatigue, and this was exactly what sparked my interest in pursuing my PhD study that aims to better understand individual’s perceptual responses in self-regulation of exercise.\nTraditionally, it has been thought that fatigue stems from your physiological limits. From such a perspective, why somebody slows down during a race is completely due to physiological reasons such as depletion of muscle glycogen, lactate, environmental stress or the inability of your heart to supply enough oxygen to the muscles. As a result, the athlete is unable to recruit more muscle fibers to meet the exercise demands and hence slowing down. However, if such hypothesis is true, it is not possible for the athlete to speed up at the end of the race when he or she is supposed to feel the most exhausted."

    "text": "The Central Governor\nThis paradox was first challenged by famous South African sport scientist, Professor Tim Noakes, who also authored the running bible, Lore of Running. In 1996, he delivered the prestigious J. B. Wolffe Memorial Lecture at the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) conference. He pointed out that most people did not die running a marathon, which meant they could have ran faster during the race. Therefore, the traditional physiological model was flawed. He later went on to publish a new theoretical model to explain regulation of exercise performance, termed the “Central Governor”, which remains a hot debating topic in the sports science domain to date.\nThis model postulates that exercise performance is regulated by a centralized control center, the brain. Exercise performance is regulated in a manner based on constant feedback between the body and the brain. As we push the limits of our body, the brain generates a whole range of sensations consciously felt by us. The sensations felt during exercise are not the consequences of fatigue, but a protective mechanism to ensure that we complete our exercise in a safe manner. In short, the brain stops us from exercising to the point that we kill ourselves."

    "section": "Why study perception?",
    "text": "Why study perception?\nIt is important to understand that in the context of an endurance event such as a marathon, athletes regulate their exercise performance in an anticipatory manner. This means individuals including novice runners naturally try to pace themselves in a sustainable manner to complete the race. Research have empirically shown that athletes slow down way before they reach the critical core temperature, and before the glycogen tank completely empties. Regulation of exercise is based on the perceived sensations during exercise, which help to provide feedback on finding the balance between safety and performance.\nWhy is there a need to study perceptual responses in sports given the tools to monitor a myriad of objective physiological measures such as heart rate, oxygen consumption and blood lactate? This is because when you think you have reached your point of exhaustion during exercise, the truth is you didn’t.\n\nIt is a perceived failure, and not a true failure.\n\nIt is quite impossible to run yourself to true failure in the context of exercise performance. Your true performance probably only happens when you face a life-and-death situation, such as being chased by a lion. This differentiation between a perceived and true failure is very important, as perceptual responses can be influenced by many other factors besides physiological variables.\nThis is the reason why placebo and psychological effects can affect performance. These effects alter your perceptual responses, and hence your performance. In the words of an Italian sport physiologist, Professor Samuele Marcora, effort perception is claimed to be the “cardinal exercise stopper”. Therefore, whatever factors that can influence your perception can ultimately influence your exercise performance.\nYour perception is in fact your reality."

    "text": "Ball possession is an important performance indicator in football. This article explores the use of logistic regression model to examine a binary classification problem: whether ball possession predicts match win or not.\nBall possession in football is seen as an imperative aspect of the game. Many successful teams are often characterised by dominating long periods of possession. The first team that sprints to your mind with such nature of play is likely the Spanish giants, Barcelona. They are often defined by their “tiki-taka” style of play, which constitutes short passing and movement to maintain possession.\nPast research have claimed that possession is a critical performance indicator that can differentiate successful teams. Better performing teams tend to maintain significantly longer possession as compared to the less successful teams. In the context of football, it does not matter if you can possess the ball for extended periods but failing to win the match. This leads to an important question, can possession predict wins in football?\nIn view of the imminent English Premier League (EPL) season, let’s revisit last EPL season’s data to answer this question! The data set consists of all results from the total 380 matches played throughout the season. Each row represents the match statistics of a team in a given match. You may see a preview of the data below."

Firstly, let’s visualise the possession of each team ranked by their ball possession!\n\n\n\n\n\nNo surprise that the EPL champions, Manchester City, with the most points tallied also had the most dominating ball possession among all the teams. From the graph, we can see that there is some truth to the claim, with the “top six” teams all ahead in the ball possession rankings as compared to the rest of the league. The highest ball possession recorded was a whopping 82% by Manchester City during match day 29 away to Bournemouth. However, the score did not truly reflect such one-sided dominance, with City edging Bournemouth by just a goal.\n\n\n\nEach data point represents the possession and match outcome of a team. 1 denotes a match win, while 0 denotes otherwise (draw or loss)."

With so much emphasis on ball possession in today’s football, this scatter plot seems to tell us otherwise, with no clear threshold of possession level that guarantees a win. We can see that a winning team can have close to 20% of possession while a non-winning team can have close to 80% of possession. For example, Crystal Palace pulled off a surprising win (3-2) against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on match day 18, with only 21% of ball possession during the match. Therefore, is ball possession a reliable predictor of match wins?"

The problem is simplified to be a binary classification scenario, whereby the result can only have two outcomes: either win or otherwise (i.e. draw or loss). Since the dependent variable is categorical in nature, logistic regression is employed to help us answer our question. In this example, we make use of the StatsModel module, which is an open-sourced Python module encompassing several statistical functions. You may see the summary of the logistic regressions result below.\n\n\nThe results showed that ball possession is a significant predictor of match wins. This suggests that possession is indeed a meaningful indicator of a match outcome. The coefficient of the possession variable is 0.0335, and this implies that when ball possession level increases by 1%, the odds of winning the match increase by 3.41%. Greater ball possession could translate to more creation of goal-scoring opportunities. Possessing the ball more also means reducing opponent’s chances of scoring since a team will need to have the ball first before they can even try to score. Such situations could contribute to a greater likelihood of winning the match."

    "text": "How accurate is this model?\nIn this example, the logistic regression model was trained with the data from all matches in EPL season 18/19. We could deploy the model to predict a match outcome given an input amount of possession levels. The model predicts by calculating the probability of either outcomes (value between 0 and 1). In this example, if a given possession level has a probability of winning greater than 0.5, it will be predicted that the team wins the match and vice versa.\nIn the field of machine learning and data science, the accuracy rate of a classification model can often be interpreted through a confusion matrix. A confusion matrix is a simple table that shows the accuracy of the model by comparing the predicted values with the actual values in the data set. You may see the confusion matrix for this example below.\n\n\n\nConfusion matrix of logistic regression model. Note- 1 denotes win, 0 denotes otherwise (draw or loss).\n\n\nThe confusion matrix compares all 760 predicted outcomes with the actual recorded outcomes. From the matrix, we can see that 372 cases were correctly predicted to be non-wins, also termed the true negatives. 204 cases were incorrectly predicted to be non-wins when they actually produced match wins in reality. Such cases are termed false negatives. 79 cases were also incorrectly predicted to be winning outcomes when they were actually non-wins, also known as the false positives. Lastly, 105 cases were correctly predicted to be classified as match wins, which are regarded as the true positives.\n\nAccuracy rate = (372+105)/760 * 100\n\nThis model was found to be 62.76% accurate! I will leave it to your personal judgement whether this model is acceptable. Obviously, football is a game with so many variables that can influence the outcome of a match. Therefore, it is not surprising to expect such accuracy of a simple model with a single predictor variable. Nevertheless, this post showcases that ball possession is a significant variable that can help us predict match outcomes. However, possession itself does not tell the full story."

    "text": "Is the English Premier League more or less competitive as compared to a decade ago? This article examines and compares the competitiveness of different seasons based on the coefficient of variation metric.\nPresently, Liverpool is en route to being runaway champions in the English Premier League (EPL), with 22 points separating them from second-placed Manchester City. Incredibly, the premier league leaders have gone a total of 42 games unbeaten at the moment, with their last defeat happening at the Ethihad Stadium on 3rd January 2019.\nInevitably, this invites a comparison between Liverpool and the “Invincible” Arsenal team. The latter currently holds the record for the longest unbeaten EPL run with 49 games in 2003/2004. To date, the record has stood for close to 16 years. Can Liverpool surpass this incredible record? In an online article, former Arsenal player Robert Pires commented that if Liverpool goes on to break the record, the league was much harder in the past as compared to present.\nIs he right to say that? This article examines whether the present EPL is indeed getting easier as compared to many years ago. First, let’s visualise how many points were required to become champions across the different past seasons since 2000/2001.\nBased on the figure, we can clearly see that teams need at least 80 points to win the titles. The “Invincible” Arsenal team achieved a total of 90 points in 2003/2004 to lift the championship trophy. However, it is interesting to point out that 90 points would be insufficient to win the league over the past three seasons. Liverpool fans would be especially frustrated that despite accumulating 97 points in 2018/2019 season, they were still that tiny bit shy of the title. Hence, is the league really becoming less competitive like what Robert Pires said?"

    "section": "Coefficient of variation",
    "text": "Coefficient of variation\nWith the aim to evaluate the competitiveness of the league, we will use the coefficient of variation (CV) metric. CV is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of a dataset by its mean. It simply represents the relative spread/variance of the data, and ranges between 0 to 1. In finance, CV is used to assess the volatility of stocks. In this article’s context, we compare the competitiveness of different EPL seasons based on each season’s CV. If a league is more competitive, we will expect that the point total of teams to be closer to one another, hence a lower CV. On the other hand, a higher CV represents less competitiveness as there is greater spread in point total among teams.\n\nThe figure above illustrates the CV across different seasons. Generally, we see there’s relatively greater variation in more recent seasons as compared to the past. For example, there’s 29% variation in 2003/2004 season as compared to 39% variation in 2018/2019. Based on the graph, the most competitive season was probably in 2010/2011 with the least variation of 25%. This suggests that there’s some truth in Robert Pires’s comments.\n\nNext, let’s further analyse the competitiveness of the league based on different standings of the table. The figure above illustrates the CV of the top six teams across different seasons. This tells a slightly different story as compared to the previous graph. The higher CVs were observed in 2003/2004 and 2004/2005 seasons, which suggests greater dispersion in point total among the top teams. This implies relatively less of a close battle for the title in these two seasons. In contrast, we see a clear trend of decreasing CV from season 2005/2006 onwards till about 2015/2016. This coincides with the shift of the traditional “Top Four” (Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool) dominance to the emergence of the “Big Six” with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City joining in to challenge for the title.\nAlthough there’s an increase in CV among the top six teams in recent seasons, it is still comparatively less than the “Invincible” season. This suggests that it is much more competitive among the top teams in recent seasons as compared to the past. This also indicates that challenging for a champions league qualifying spot is much tougher now than two decades ago.\nIn conclusion, while the league may be more competitive overall in the past, there is less competition among the top teams when comes to challenging for the title or qualifying for the champions league as compared to present seasons.\nDo you agree with Robert Pires’s comments?"
